Hi, this is Yuyuan Lin, a Ph.D. candidate in Epidemiology at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I got my bachelor's degree in preventative medicine from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine in 2019 and my MPH degree in chronic disease epidemiology from Yale University in 2021. My research interest in on the intersection of epidemiology, biostatistics, and data science. I am particularly interested in learning disease mechanisms using omics data. My dissertation topic is about pesticide exposure and metabolic signatures of neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. 

I am also hosting a Chinese podcast called [羊乘林](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/podcast/624900e9f33bb86cde89b214) with my partner Yijun. This podcast is focused on different areas of public health and epidemiology. We are trying to make knowledge in our field more accessible to the general public.
